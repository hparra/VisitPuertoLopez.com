<h1>Agua Blanca Village</h1>

<p>Agua Blanca is a private community within Machalilla National Park hosting remains of one of the most ancient civilizations in South America, the Monte√±o, along with trails and a sulfur lagoon.</p>
<p>The trailhead to your right immediately after the main gate takes you through a 5km trail along the riverbed and ends before the museum.</p>
<p>From the museum, a guide will take through a short nature trail with a couple of river crossings. Since it's also an easy, flat trail it's recommended you wear sandals. At the end of this trail is the sulfur lagoon. You're encouraged to jump in, so bring your swimwear. Mud is routinely collected from the bottom of this pool so guests can apply their own facial mud masks. There are bathrooms and a facility to change and shower next to the lagoon.</p>
<p>Once you are finished relaxing in the lagoon, the guide will return you to the museum through another path which contains a lookout point.</p> 
<p>The community is open to the public from 8am-6pm</p>
<p>You may only camp on these grounds with a guide. There may be an extra fee for this.</p>

<h2>How do I get there?</h2>
<p>The entrance to Agua Blanca is about 6.5km north of Puerto Lopez. A bus will take you to the front gate for US$0.40, while a mototaxi may charge you between US$4-US$5 depending on whether they drop you off at the museum 5km from the gate.</p>
<p>If you don't wish to walk back to the gate and catch a bus back, do arrange a pickup with a mototaxi.</p>

<h2>How much?</h2>
<p>There is a US$5 fee to enter the park. This fee includes a guided tour through their museum and to the sulfur lagoon.</p>
