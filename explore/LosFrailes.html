<h1>Los Frailes Beach Park</h1>

<p>Los Frailes is an enclosed beach park composed of a nature trail and three individual beaches, the largest being Los Frailes. This is the place to come to explore and relax.</p>
<p>The trailhead to your right immediately after the main gate takes you through a shaded trail that runs through all beaches and lookout points.</p>
<p>A facility next to Los Frailes beach has bathrooms, changing rooms, and fresh water showers.</p>
<p>The beach is open from 8am-4pm</p>
<p>You may NOT camp on this beach.</p>


<h2>How do I get there?</h2>
