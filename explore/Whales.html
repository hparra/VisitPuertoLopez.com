<h1>Whales!</h1>

<p>The whales make their yearly pitstop along the coast of Ecuador between June and September to mate, give birth, and entertain humans fascinated by their everyday behavior. They surface to take a deep breath, blow water into the air, and every now and then decide to shoot out into the sky. Most trips last between 30 and 45 minutes.</p>

<h2>How do I get there?</h2>
<p>By boat of course! There are ten (10) tour agencies in Puerto Lopez that are licensed to take visitors on whale watching tours. Many have offices along the beach area around the plaza.</p>

<h2>How much?</h2>
<p>A whale watching trip costs between US$15-US$20 depending on whether or not it is high season. Most people do a combined whale and Isla de la Plata tour.</p>

<h2>What should I bring?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Seasickness medication</li>
<li>Camera and dry bag for that camera</li>
<li>Sunscreen, a hat, and sun glasses</li>
</ul>
<p>Many agencies provide water and snacks, but you may want to bring you're own water bottle.</p>
